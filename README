BUILD
-----
Default build use ldc2 as D compiler and build as a static lib. Use flag -j for speed up.
Commonly we use this formula: number of cores x 2 + 1
so if you have 4 cores: 4 x 2 + 1 = 9
In this case you add to make command this flag -j 9.

 - ldc2:
$ make
 - dmd:
$ make DC=dmd
 - gdc:
$ make DC=gdc

- build as shared lib:
$ make shared-lib

- Add D flag to build
$ make DCFLAGS+="-w -g -O3"


INSTALL
-------

- Install: static lib, doc, header, pkgfile
$ make install

-Install: shared lib, doc, header, pkgfile
$ make install-shared

- Install both static and shared lib:   static lib, shared lib, doc, header, pkgfile
$ make install install-shared-lib
